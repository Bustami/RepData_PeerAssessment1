    # Loading and preprocessing the data
    
    ```r
    rawdata<-read.csv("activity.csv",sep=",",header=T,stringsAsFactors=F)
    rawdata[,2]<-as.Date(rawdata$date,"%Y-%m-%d")
    j<-0
    for (i in 1:length(rawdata[,3]))
    {
            rawdata[i,3]<-5*j
            j<-j+1
            if (j==288)
            {
                    j<-0        
            }

    # What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
    
    ```r
    TotalSteps<-tapply(rawdata$steps,rawdata$date,sum)

    ```r
    Mean<-mean(TotalSteps,na.rm=T)
    Median<-median(TotalSteps,na.rm=T)
    ```
    The mean of total number of steps taken per day is 1.0766189\times 10^{4}  
    The median of total number of steps taken per day is 10765
      
    # What is the average daily activity pattern?
    
    ```r
    DailyAverage<-tapply(rawdata$steps,rawdata$interval,mean,na.rm=T)
    plot(x<-0:1:287,DailyAverage,type="l",xlab="5 minutes representantive daily interval")
    ```
    
    ```
    ## Warning in 0:1:287: numerical expression has 2 elements: only the first

    ```r
    IndexMaxDA<-as.numeric(which.max(DailyAverage))
    ```
    The 5-minute interval N° 104 contains the maximum number of steps on average across all the days in the dataset.  
    There is more activity in the mornings, roughly at 9:00 am.
      
    #Imputing missing values
    
    ```r
    TotalNA<-sum(is.na(rawdata$steps))
    ```
    The total number of mssing values is 2304  
      
    ##Filling the missing values with the mean for each 5-minute interval:
    
    ```r
    newdata<-rawdata
    for (i in 1:length(DailyAverage))
    {
            if (is.na(newdata[i,1])==T)
            {
                    newdata[i,1] = DailyAverage[i] 
            }     
    }
    TotalSteps2<-tapply(newdata$steps,newdata$date,sum)
    hist(TotalSteps2,col="blue",main="Total steps taken per day (NA filled)")
    ```
    
    <img src="PA1_template_files/figure-html/hist2-1.png" title="" alt="" width="672" />
    
    ```r
    Mean2<-mean(TotalSteps2,na.rm=T)
    Median2<-median(TotalSteps2,na.rm=T)
    ```
    The mean of total number of steps taken per day, with dataset with the filled-in missing values, is 1.0766189\times 10^{4}  
    The median of total number of steps taken per day, with dataset with the filled-in missing values, is 1.0765594\times 10^{4}  
      
    The results don't have significant changes respect to the dataset with missing values, hence the impact is negligible.

    There are difference in the activity patterns between weekdays and weekends, specifically at the beginning of the day ( 6:00 am ) where the weekdays have more activity, and afternoon (between 12 and 08 pm), where the weekends have more activity.
